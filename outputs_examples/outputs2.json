However, this is a general figure, and it's not clear how it applies specifically to medium-sized businesses with around 450 employees.\n\nTo estimate the number of businesses with employees restrained by co-worker non-solicitation clauses, we can assume that the prevalence of these clauses is similar across all businesses, including medium-sized ones. \n\nGiven the total sample of 560 medium-sized businesses, we can calculate the expected number of businesses with employees restrained by co-worker non-solicitation clauses as follows:\n\nExpected number of businesses with employees restrained by co-worker non-solicitation clauses = Total sample size x Prevalence of co-worker non-solicitation clauses\n= 560 x 0.18\n= 100.8\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we can expect approximately 101 businesses with employees restrained by co-worker non-solicitation clauses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 101."
